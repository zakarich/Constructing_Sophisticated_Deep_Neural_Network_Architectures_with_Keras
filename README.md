# Constructing Sophisticated Deep Neural Network Architectures with Keras

The Keras Functional API is an extension to the Sequential model that provides greater flexibility in building complex models. It achieves this by allowing us to combine simple building blocks, each of which takes one or more inputs, processes them, and returns one output. This article provides an overview of the architecture of the Keras Functional API and includes examples of how to use it for your own purposes.

## 1. Importing the data and constructing a basic model.
Initially, we will import the MNSIT Fashion dataset, which we will be utilizing throughout this article. This dataset comprises various fashion categories and has ten distinct classes.

We will import the dataset using the Keras.datasets library, divide it into training and validation sets, and then normalize the data.

## 2. Creating a wide and deep neural network.
In this section, we will create a wide and deep neural network using the Keras Functional API. This type of architecture allows us to learn both low-level features and high-level features from our data.

## 3. Developing a wide and deep neural network with several inputs.
In this section, we will extend our model to accept multiple inputs. This can be useful when we have data from different sources or in different formats that we want to feed into our model.

## 4. Constructing a wide and deep neural network with multiple inputs and outputs.
In this section, we will further extend our model to have multiple outputs. This can be useful when we want to make multiple predictions or when we have multiple tasks that we want our model to perform.
