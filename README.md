# Constructing Sophisticated Deep Neural Network Architectures with Keras

The Keras Functional API is an extension to the Sequential model that provides greater flexibility in building complex models. It achieves this by allowing us to combine simple building blocks, each of which takes one or more inputs, processes them, and returns one output. This article provides an overview of the architecture of the Keras Functional API and includes examples of how to use it for your own purposes.
